## ✨ Why Readmd?

web page as a page,is an important way for people to get informations.But we can`t to touch directly and change it by what we want to,so I made this to help to let reading more easy and comfortable.

Modern web pages are cluttered with ads, sidebars, navigation bars, and popups. Readmd strips all of that away and gives you a beautiful, customizable reading environment. But it doesn't stop at reading — **Readmd is also your digital notebook**. Highlight important passages, scribble notes in the margins, add text annotations, and export everything as a polished HTML or PDF file.

Think of it as **Readability + Notability**, right in your browser.

## 🚀 Features

### 📰 Smart Content Extraction

- Powered by Mozilla's [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) algorithm
- Automatically identifies and extracts the main article body
- Filters out navigation, ads, sidebars, and other clutter
- Falls back intelligently if auto-extraction fails

### 📖 Immersive Reading Mode

- Full-screen overlay with high `z-index` isolation — no CSS conflicts
- Code blocks get special treatment: visual separation, scrollable containers, proper dedentation
- SVG elements are automatically normalized and stabilized for consistent rendering
- Quick toggle: click the extension icon or use the popup controls

### 📐 Single / Dual Page Layout

- **Single page**: Classic scrolling, great for focused reading
- **Dual page**: Book-like two-column layout, ideal for wide screens
- Seamless layout switching without losing your reading position

### 🎨 10 Themes + Font Size Control

- **Light themes**: Light, Eye-care Yellow, Bean Green, Lavender Purple, Mist Gray, Ocean Blue
- **Dark themes**: Dark, Dark Purple, Dark Gray, Dark Blue
- Font size adjustable from 14px to 24px
- All preferences synced across devices via `chrome.storage.sync`

### 📍 Reading Progress Memory

- Automatically remembers where you left off — per URL
- Restores scroll position when you re-enter reading mode
- Works across both single and dual page layouts

### ✏️ Full Annotation Suite

This is where Readmd truly shines. The annotation engine operates in two modes:

#### DOM Highlight Mode

- Select any text in the reading view and apply fluorescent highlight colors
- 8 preset highlight colors with a floating color palette
- Click existing highlights to recolor or remove them
- Highlights survive undo/redo and are preserved in exports

#### Canvas Annotation Mode

When you need more than just highlights, Readmd captures a high-resolution snapshot of the content and lets you draw on top:

- **🖊️ Pen**: Freehand drawing with configurable color, size (S/M/L), and opacity
- **🧹 Eraser**: Remove strokes cleanly
- **💬 Text Notes**: Click anywhere to add editable text annotations (with edit ✏️ and delete × buttons)
- **🖍️ Highlighter**: Wide, translucent strokes for emphasis
- **🎨 Color Picker**: 8 preset colors + native OS color picker for custom colors
- **🖐️ Pan Mode**: Grab and drag to navigate large pages
- **↩️ Undo/Redo**: 50-step history, works across all tool types
- **🗑️ Clear All**: Reset everything in one click

### 📄 Export

Export your annotated reading as a self-contained file:

- **📄 Export HTML**: Annotations, highlights, text notes — all preserved in a standalone HTML file
- **📑 Export PDF**: Multi-page PDF with proper A4 pagination, annotations merged onto the content
